# Atomic Design - Component Library

This project is a component library built using atomic design.

Live site: ðŸš€https://johnobla.github.io/ps-react-johnobla/ðŸš€

- Documentation is auto-generated from each component using `react-docgen`.
- Prop details, component examples, and related code are auto-extracted and displayed on the component's page.

### To do:

1. Add styling to site.
2. Create homepage.
3. Sort `components` by atoms, molecules, organisms, etc.
4. Switch from hash routing to Next.js.

## Folder Structure

### `./src/components`

Atoms, molecules, and organisms, as well as their tests and styling.

### `./src/docs`

Example component folder, client-side page navigation, and code styling.

### `./src/docs/examples`

Example use cases for each component, which will appear on each component's page.
